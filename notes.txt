** Adding AppLoading

We will do this by importing it like this:
 import { AppLoading } from 'expo';

This might fail for you - depending on the version of Expo you're using to follow along.

If it does fail, try this alternative way of adding it:
    expo install expo-app-loading
    import AppLoading from 'expo-app-loading';

Also add the following prop to the <AppLoading /> component (in your JSX code):
    onError={(err) => console.log(err)}

In the end, you should have:

    <AppLoading
        startAsync={fetchFonts}
        onFinish={() => setFontLoaded(true)}
        onError={(err) => console.log(err)}
    />

React Native Docs

In case you want to dive into the official docs as well, 
you can find the official docs here: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/4.x/getting-started

----------------------
React  Navigation  packages
    yarn  add  react-navigation
    expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated 
    react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view

Install Navigators

Also add this import in the file where you are using createStackNavigator:

    import { createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation-stack';

Same for TabsNavigator (used a little bit later in this module):

    npm install --save react-navigation-tabs

    import { createBottomTabNavigator } from 'react-navigation-tabs';

And also for DrawerNavigator (also used later in this module):

    npm install --save react-navigation-drawer

    import { createDrawerNavigator } from 'react-navigation-drawer';
