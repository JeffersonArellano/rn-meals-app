** Adding AppLoading

We will do this by importing it like this:
 import { AppLoading } from 'expo';

This might fail for you - depending on the version of Expo you're using to follow along.

If it does fail, try this alternative way of adding it:
    expo install expo-app-loading
    import AppLoading from 'expo-app-loading';

Also add the following prop to the <AppLoading /> component (in your JSX code):
    onError={(err) => console.log(err)}

In the end, you should have:

    <AppLoading
        startAsync={fetchFonts}
        onFinish={() => setFontLoaded(true)}
        onError={(err) => console.log(err)}
    />
